# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: November 17, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: began new website in HTML & CSS, completed [Git-it workshop](https://github.com/jlord/git-it-electron) found on [NodeSchool core workshops](https://nodeschool.io/index.html#workshopper-list)

**Thoughts** It was hard to get started on the first day of 100, but the Git-it workshop was super helpful and engaging, and made it especially worthwhile to show up today! Looking forward to more...
