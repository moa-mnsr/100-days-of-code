# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 8: November 30, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: began Javascripting workshop, practiced tons & tons w/ command line & git on new sites/repos

**Thoughts** I started a lot of web projects I have been talking about today or at least set up the repositories for them. I also realized that the two blogs I wanted to make center around a related theme (if not obviously, at least for me personally) and could be housed together under an umbrella page that explains this. And that connecting them could be its own project, or a more conceptual one.

Otherwise, made progress far and wide...it was good to get my feet a little wetter with JavaScript as I feel I have been avoiding studying it for a while for fear it will be too difficult, or that I am not ready. It felt important to take some more little steps! ...and way less scary than I thought, after all :)

### Day 7: November 27, Friday

**Today's Progress**: tweaks & collaboration on html in project

**Thoughts**: It was really nice to work with a friend again and we figured out how to communicate our progress in between sessions. I noticed from looking at the site on my phone how badly and naturally I wanted to click the images laid out in the flexbox, and then they would grow bigger, or full-size on the screen. The nicer way to do this would probably be a lightbox but I would like to make sure I understand the JavaScript first before using it (based on an example found on W3 schools).

### Day 6: November 24, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: worked on poem site involving flexbox & grid; improving understanding of posititioning and alignment of items/text/content within grids especially

**Thoughts** Today felt like a breakthrough on a lot of material I have been trying to grasp a long time! 

It helped that instead of exporting this project directly from Glitch to GitHub, I downloaded the files from Glitch and revised parts of what I already had by rewriting from scratch, with the old files and the new file side by side in Visual Studio Code to compare. I made sure I didn't copy any of the original unless I knew exactly what each part did and meant. This was immensely helpful, and [DevDocs](https://devdocs.io/) was totally invaluable - saved loads of time researching and was a lot cleaner, clearer and easier to use than the resources I have turned to in the past. 

Lastly - I was very happy to be working on my own project of the sort that motivated me to learn code in the first place. Review and exercises are important and sometimes easier on days when I don't have quite the right energy for confronting the immensity of everything I don't know about implementing the designs I've made (which I sometimes compare to composing music for an instrument you haven't really learned yet - like writing a complex cello piece when you can still only play scales...). But putting an art project to life for me is the greatest satisfaction, and makes all the puzzling elements of code much fun to put together.

### Day 5: November 23, Monday

**Today's Progress**: made flex-box, tweaked homepage, linked to etherpad

**Thoughts** It was so much fun to collaborate on this today and made me feel very energized for more! Also my friend gave good advice about simplifying the process of working on new things for me. It's really exciting that this website is for a group we made and can actually be used to share information, and am excited for it to grow over time.

### Day 4: November 22, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: used JavaScript for the first time to make a button, reviewed HTML & CSS with a challenge task on Codepen and by completing more learnyouhtml workshop

**Thoughts** Felt good to make first foray into JavaScript, also enjoyed the immediacy of Codepen a lot. CSS review felt helpful. Feeling ready & eager to start learning JavaScript more steadily now!

### Day 3: November 19, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: continued html workshop from yesterday to review basics, followed by a long hard lesson in git

**Thoughts** Today the time spent after coding was very frustrating, but I really learned a lot about Git & GitHub after quite a lot of fussing to fix mistakes I didn't know I made yesterday to the working tree. So -- progress! It felt like both an accomplishment and a relief to discover I could ultimately figure it out.

### Day 2: November 18, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: reviewed basic html from [NodeSchool core workshops](https://nodeschool.io/index.html#workshopper-list) to practice using linux terminal and pushing to git

**Thoughts** Really enjoying the "workshopper" format and using the command line! Review felt good today after learning a lot about Git last night. Having one easier familiar thing to practice alongside one newer and more challenging thing was a helpful model.

### Day 1: November 17, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: began new website in HTML & CSS, completed [Git-it workshop](https://github.com/jlord/git-it-electron) found on [NodeSchool core workshops](https://nodeschool.io/index.html#workshopper-list)

**Thoughts** It was hard to get started on the first day of 100, but the Git-it workshop was super helpful and engaging, and made it especially worthwhile to show up today! Looking forward to more...
