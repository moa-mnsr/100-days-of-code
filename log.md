# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 2: November 18, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: reviewed basic html from [NodeSchool core workshops](https://nodeschool.io/index.html#workshopper-list) to practice using linux terminal and pushing to git

**Thoughts** Really enjoying the "workshopper" format and using the command line! Review felt good today after learning a lot about Git last night. Having one easier familiar thing to practice alongside one newer and more challenging thing was a helpful model.

### Day 1: November 17, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: began new website in HTML & CSS, completed [Git-it workshop](https://github.com/jlord/git-it-electron) found on [NodeSchool core workshops](https://nodeschool.io/index.html#workshopper-list)

**Thoughts** It was hard to get started on the first day of 100, but the Git-it workshop was super helpful and engaging, and made it especially worthwhile to show up today! Looking forward to more...
