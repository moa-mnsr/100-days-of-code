# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: November 17, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: began new website in HTML & CSS, completed [Git-it workshop](https://github.com/jlord/git-it-electron) found on [NodeSchool core workshops](https://nodeschool.io/index.html#workshopper-list)

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
